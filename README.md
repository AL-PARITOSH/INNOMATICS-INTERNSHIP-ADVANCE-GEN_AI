# Python Basics Assignment – Log and Data Processing

## Overview

This assignment demonstrates the implementation of fundamental Python programming concepts.  
The tasks are designed to simulate real-world scenarios such as authentication systems, academic result analysis, message validation, and system log monitoring.

The assignment emphasizes:

- User input handling  
- List operations  
- Conditional statements  
- Looping constructs  
- String manipulation  
- Usage of `map()` and `split()`  
- Basic data processing logic

## Problem Statements and Implementation Details

### 1. Login Validation

**Objective:**  
Validate user login credentials.

**Requirements:**
- Accept username and password from user input  
- Compare with predefined credentials  
- Print:
  - "Login Successful" if both match  
  - "Invalid Credentials" otherwise  

**Concepts Used:**  
Conditional statements, logical operators, user input handling.

### 2. Student Result Analysis

**Objective:**  
Analyze student marks and determine pass/fail statistics.

**Requirements:**
- Accept marks using `map()`  
- A student passes if marks ≥ 50  
- Count total pass students  
- Count total fail students  
- Display passed and failed students with their respective marks  

**Concepts Used:**  
Lists, loops, indexing, conditional logic, `map()` function.

### 3. Username Cleaning and Standardization

**Objective:**  
Standardize user-provided names.

**Requirements:**
- Accept multiple names as input  
- Remove extra spaces  
- Convert all names to lowercase  
- Display cleaned names separated by commas  

**Concepts Used:**  
String methods (`strip()`, `lower()`), `split()`, `join()`, `map()`.

---

### 4. Message Size Analyzer

**Objective:**  
Analyze message length and detect long messages.

**Requirements:**
- Accept multiple messages  
- Print length of each message  
- Flag messages longer than 10 characters  

**Concepts Used:**  
String length calculation using `len()`, loops, condition checking.

---

### 5. System Log Error Detection

**Objective:**  
Detect and count error messages from system logs.

**Requirements:**
- Accept log entries as input  
- Count the number of `"ERROR"` entries  
- Print total error count  

**Concepts Used:**  
String comparison, iteration, counting logic.
